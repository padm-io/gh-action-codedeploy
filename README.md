# GitHub Action to automate deployment with aws CodeDeploy ðŸ”„

This simple action uses the [vanilla AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) to create a deployment with a AWS CODEDEPLOY

## Usage

### `workflow.yml` Example

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

#### The following example includes code deployment from revision is stored in s3 bucket for a website:

```yaml
name: MyApp

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: aws CodeDeploy
        uses: padm-io/gh-action-codedeploy@main
        env:
          AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_REGION: "ap-south-1" # optional: defaults to ap-south-1
          WAIT_FOR_BUILD: true
          AWS_S3_LOCATION_KEY: app_v1.0.0.zip # Replace with your build's3-key
          AWS_S3_BUNDLE_TYPE: "zip" # tar | tgz | zip | YAML | JSON
          AWS_CODEDEPLOY_APP_NAME: "myapp"
          AWS_CODEDEPLOY_GROUP_NAME: "myapp_compute"
```

### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€”Â otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.
